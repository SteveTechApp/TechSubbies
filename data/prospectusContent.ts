        <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
        <p>TechSubbies.com is a vertically-integrated Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform targeting the high-value, specialist freelance technical market in the UK, beginning with the Audio Visual (AV) and IT sectors. Our model disrupts the traditional, inefficient recruitment agency market by leveraging technology to create direct, transparent, and efficient connections between freelance engineers and the companies that hire them.</p>

This engineer-funded model allows us to offer the platform for free to companies, removing the primary barrier to entry and enabling us to capture the entire hiring market. We project achieving profitability within 24 months post-seed funding, with a target of 10,000 paying subscribers within three years.</p>

    marketOpportunity: `
        <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
        <p>The UK recruitment industry is valued at over £48 billion annually, with a significant portion dedicated to temporary and contract technical staffing. This market is dominated by traditional agencies that rely on manual processes, resulting in high fees (typically 15-25% of the contract value), slow hiring cycles, and a lack of transparency.</p>
        <p>The freelance economy, or 'gig economy', continues to grow, with highly skilled technical professionals increasingly opting for flexible contract work. TechSubbies.com is perfectly positioned at the intersection of these trends, offering a scalable, low-cost alternative that benefits both sides of the marketplace.</p>
