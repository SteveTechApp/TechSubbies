                    Steve Goodwin's journey to founding TechSubbies.com wasn't forged in a startup incubator; it was built over a quarter-century of deep, hands-on experience within the professional AV industry. He's not just a CEO; he's an industry veteran who has seen the challenges of technical staffing from every possible perspective.

                <p>
                    Throughout his extensive career, Steve has held key leadership roles across the entire supply chain. As an integrator, he understood the critical need for reliable, skilled engineers on the ground. As a Technical Director for a major distributor, he saw the gap between product potential and field expertise. And while working for leading manufacturers, he recognized the challenge of ensuring their cutting-edge technology was supported by a qualified freelance workforce.

                <p>
                   This unique 360-degree view gave him unparalleled insight into the industry's biggest bottleneck: finding the right specialist for the right job, quickly and efficiently. He grew frustrated with the slow, expensive, and often inaccurate traditional recruitment model, where high fees benefited middlemen rather than the clients and the engineers themselves.

                 <p>
                    TechSubbies.com is the culmination of that experience. It's a platform built on a deep understanding of what the industry truly needs: a direct, transparent, and technology-driven way for companies to connect with verified, skilled freelance talent. Steve's mission is to leverage technology to solve a problem he has lived with for decades, empowering both companies and engineers to build better, more efficiently, and more profitably.
